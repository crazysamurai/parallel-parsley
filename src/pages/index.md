      Welcome to my Web Development blog.

    content: >-
      I'm a Computer Science student currently living in India. I've always been into computers and programming and in the past few years, I've developed a great interest in both. I'm specifically interested in Web Development and contributing to open source, I mean c'mon who doesn't like to break code ðŸ˜‰. I'm always working on something because there's not much to do these days.
      Other than coding I play Badminton, do endurance running, and play games on my PC just like everyone else. I hope you enjoy reading these articles. Any feedback is appreciated. Good luck!
